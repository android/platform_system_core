Looking at the history, it looks we\u0027re not replacing \"28\", but \"${PLATFORM_SDK_VERSION}\" directly, though no current branches appear to be using \"${PLATFORM_SDK_VERSION}\".\n\nThat\u0027s actually a lot easier to fix now that I know we aren\u0027t using \"28\". I uploaded a new development/ CL.\n\nAnd I fixed adb as well.",
