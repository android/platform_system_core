      "message": "We can\u0027t leak TaskProfiles every time TaskProfiles::GetInstance() is called. It\u0027s called lots of times. Maybe you meant to write:\n\nstatic auto* instance \u003d new TaskProfiles;\n\nto create it once, reuse it many times and never to delete?\n\nThe fact that it\u0027s racing during the process exit is surprising to me. AFAIK this is quite a standard way of creating \"Meyers Singletons\" in C++11. However I\u0027ll doubt myself and will consult with others tomorrow.\nThanks for bringing it up!",
