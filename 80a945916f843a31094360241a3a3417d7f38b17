      "message": "I think it may be better to block here until the pruning has completed.  I don\u0027t think pruning will take particularly long (though you may know better; have you timed this recently by chance?).  In this case, it would be a better experience for the new client to not receive data for a few 100ms, rather than have the connection closed and need to retry.\n\nSince LogBuffer::prune() already takes the LogTimeEntry lock (it says rdlock(), but it\u0027s just a normal mutex lock), and since we require the same lock below, we do defacto block accepting new clients until the prune() has completed in the first place.",
