//  The APIs in the android::f2fs_pin namespace are:
//
//  - BdevFileSystemSupportsReliablePinning() to determine if the file system mounted on a block
//    device supports reliable pinning through the FileAllocateSpaceAndReliablyPin() API;
//  - FileAllocateSpaceAndReliablyPin() to allocate space to a file and reliably pin it; and
//  - FileEnsureReliablyPinned() to determine if a file is reliably pinned.
//
//  Not every file created on an F2FS filesystem,and pinned via the I/O control operation to
//  pin a file, is reliably pinned.  F2FS in its space reclamation process (aka garbage collection)
//  will eventually unpin files storage blocks are not 100% made of fully allocated 2MB F2FS file
//  system segments.
//
//  To be able to reliably create files on an F2FS filesystem, the space for the file must be
//  allocated through the FileAllocateSpaceAndReliablyPin() API, underlying file system operations
//  that allocate space to the file must not be used.
//
//  This code is provided, isolated in its own namespace, to encapsulate these interfaces and hide
//  their implementation details.
//
//  There is disparate, unrelated code, in Android that requires access to this functionality.
//  Instead of coupling this code with various other code, it is purposely stand-alone so that
//  it can be reused more easily.
//
//  Concerns are kept separate between this code and the code that uses the API:
//      FileAllocateSpaceAndReliablyPin()
//  The file name, its creation, error handling related to its creation, its protection, and
//  any other aspects not important to the work of the API are all concerns that are left up
//  to the user of these APIs.
//
//  WARNING:
//      For a file to remain reliably pinned, its storage space must NOT be manipulated
//      in any way, either directly with fallocate(2) or ftruncate(2); or through writes
//      that make the file bigger.
//
//  For extra reliability, code that depends on reliably pinned files should verify after doing
//  whatever work needs to be done with the file (for example after it finishes writing data into
//  it), and immediately prior to closing its file desriptor, that the file is still realibly
//  pinned by calling:
//      FileEnsureReliablyPinned().

//  does not support reliably pinning, because it does not contain the patches that support
