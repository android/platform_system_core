Right? Then this is wrong.\n\n\u0027vndk\u0027 namespace exists for both system and vendor processes. And inside a process, the existence of a linker namespace is static and global. So this function will always return true.\n\nAs I said before, there current is no way to know the linker namespace that the caller is loaded at.",
