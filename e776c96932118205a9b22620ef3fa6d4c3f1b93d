      "message": "I had a typo \"default\" here before, which presumably caused a conflict with the same property earlier in the file. That caused a boot failure that was tedious to debug:\n\nOne thing is that changing this file frequently caused a bad system image that would stop with an \"unsafe\" error. My workaround was to delete out/target before every build.\n\nThe other problem was that I couldn\u0027t get any logs from the linker: The boot didn\u0027t get far enough for adb logcat to work, and the kernel log that you get through the serial console didn\u0027t include linker messages either. So I had to do bisect to find it. I\u0027d appreciate any tips on how to debug this better in the future.",
