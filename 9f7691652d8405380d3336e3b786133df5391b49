The program and the SELinux labeling config are specifying conflicting labeling decisions, which can lead to inconsistent behavior. The two processes should not fight with each other. Any program which handles labeling decisions (which it shouldn\u0027t) needs to make labeling decisions consistent with the file_contexts entry.  The correct solution is to fix the program.\n\n\nIn both of these cases, supporting --force in the init language is just masking bugs, and is incorrect.",
