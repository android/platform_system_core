      "message": "This new algorithm is an orders of magnitude slower than the previous. I believe it\u0027s due to this since you need to scan through the new map for every entry in the old.\n\nMy old algorithm only visited each element once, using a few tricks.\n\nI uploaded a change that adds a benchmark that you can run on your host machine. If you build it, then you can run it like so from the root of your android tree:\n\n  out/host/linux-x86/benchmarktest64/unwind_benchmarks/unwind_benchmarks --benchmark_filter\u003dBM_local\n\nThat runs the 64 bit version, the 32 bit version is in benchmarktest.",
