      "message": "Yeah, I did - if we extract this to a helper, bdev_fd_ will get opened with RDWR which we don\u0027t want. On the other hand, as is, the Flush() calls in gsi_service.cpp are doing nothing.\n\nIs there a reason to open a read-only fd just to fsync it? Can we do the sync after AllocateFile() and move any additional syncs needed into gsi_service.cpp?",
