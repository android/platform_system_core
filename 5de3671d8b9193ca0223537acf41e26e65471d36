      "message": "Using `struct logger* logger` is unnecessary since strict `log_id_t` (or better: `int`) is all that these functions actually need.\n\nBut I\u0027m not sure if we should break the symmetry here.  Alternatively, we could use this as the motivation to add all of the log_id_t versions of these functions and push these old versions into a cruft file.",
