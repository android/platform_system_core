      "message": "I think we should still clear this since this is a public API. The return of ReadDmaBufInfo() should return a vector of all dma buffers found. So the code in ReadDmaBufFdRefs() looks fine to me, but we don\u0027t want to depend on the caller to clear the vector etc.\n\nWe must be deterministic. If the caller wants to cross reference this with buffers from other processes or from debugfs, we can probably do that else where or in the caller itself.",

      "message": "I still think we should have a way to append data to an existing vector. Since the code is already there to handle the multiple references/one PID case, may be we can rename this to AppendDmaBufInfo and make ReadDmaBufInfo clear the vector and call it?\nWDYT?",
