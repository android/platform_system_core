If your reasoning is \"protection against [...] perhaps unintentional integer truncation,\" then make them explicit in the code.\n\n(This is a check that I would have never added to ubsan. It\u0027s not ub, has nothing to do with ub, and has an actual static counter part that makes sure there are _zero_ unforeseen crashes.)",
