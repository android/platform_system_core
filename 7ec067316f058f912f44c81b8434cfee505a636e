      "message": "Yeah, the goals were for the watchdog to use it, though it currently uses properties. I\u0027ll leave Zim to comment whether he thinks it\u0027ll still be useful in R.\n\nThe other reason was that this would allow us to get rid of the \u0027vdc\u0027 daemon, which is just a proxy for making binder calls, and this would be a good way to improve boot time. Never materialized in Q due to lack of time.\n\nRe: two-way, if it\u0027s to servicemanager I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a concern, since that is a trusted component anyway. The comments were more intended as guidelines to safely use binder from init.\n\nI\u0027m fine with removing it if Zim is, we can always add it back if we do go after the boot time improvements.",

      "message": "Tom what was the resolution from the meeting about watching properties from Java? \n\nIn R I\u0027d like init to make a one-way call to system_server when the updatable_crashing property changes, assuming Java cannot listen for this property. At the moment, we are polling this property from Java land for a short while after a boot with an update. I would like to monitor this property for longer (~2 days) without burning a thread in system_server",
