I know I could have an operator\u003d\u003d(), however that seems to not generically useful enough to do.  memcmp() won\u0027t work since there\u0027ll be padding on the end.  I actively do want to remove the union with the int that made this otherwise easy to compare, since that\u0027s not a good thing to maintain anyway.",
