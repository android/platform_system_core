Obviously it\u0027s a convenient feature.\n\nAs stated in my initial comment:\n\n\u003e The impetus for this was us trying to abstract service name revisions behind props, which we found not to be very elegant, see https://github.com/ix5/device-sony-common/commit/1a796b881adc5583d30dcbf2d7cd58966ad79f49\n\nSo more of a \"good idea\" than a dire need.\n \n\u003e I ask this because this doesn\u0027t add any new ability to init, and it\u0027s therefore technically an unnecessary addition to the init API surface. An alternative would be to start every version (and this is technically possible to automatically generate).\n\nYeah on reflection we might not want to introduce another verb into init language. Maybe using `interface_start` without any version information (i.e. `@1.1::IInterface`) internally triggers `interface_start_latest`, whereas `interface_start` with an exact fqname behaves just as before.\n\n\u003e I\u0027m really hoping to see few if any new major versions added, and most interfaces to be written using AIDL, where major versions are expected to be much rarer.\n\nAh, AIDL... still haven\u0027t fully understood why HIDL now is out of vogue and AIDL back as (s)AIDL again?\nWhy not just freeze a HIDL interface and commit to not uprev\u0027ing it, instead of introducing _yet_ another format?\nBut alas, you guys have to earn your keep somehow, I guess.",
