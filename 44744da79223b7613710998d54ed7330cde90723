      "message": "This will work for things like /data that are not in dm-linear, but I don\u0027t think it will work for things mounted through dm-linear like /system on blueline.  \n\nWe\u0027d want to return it\u0027s \u0027logical\u0027 fstab entry, right?  That means we\u0027d need to check the fstab at each iteration of the the dm recursion, right?  Since /system is mounted on dm-verity, is mounted on dm-linear (which we want to detect), is mounted on the underlying super partition.\n\nWe should add a test case that it can resolve \"/system\" as well to detect this case.",
