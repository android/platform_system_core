      "message": "AFAIK all devices are supposed to be r/o to protect us, and switched to r/w upon request as a security measure to keep the attack vectors small. Super block device is ro, and thus will/should fail up until fs_mgr_set_blk_ro(device_path, false) is called in fs_mgr_overlayfs_mount_scratch. Existence is enough, we can worry about it later if we do not have the _ability_ to switch the device to ro?",

      "message": "Agreed, I\u0027ve reverted this. It was causing presubmit failures anyway since it brought up an selinux violation in second-stage init. (Note FWIW, some non-A/B devices write-protect the super eMMC but still expose the block devices as rw, so this doesn\u0027t really buy us anything.)",
