I considered the ideal of first stage init like dried glue that holds up to most any corner cases (only components you can not override are first stage init itself, and update_engine), and the state for a late mounting as not yet set. So cement came to mind ;-}\n\nFramework folks will not need a reboot. core native components generally needs a reboot. There are variable rules in between.\n\nOf course, I just made a case to add this above desccription to the CL\u0027s commit message ...",
