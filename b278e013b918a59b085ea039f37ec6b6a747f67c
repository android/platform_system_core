      "message": "Tom, in our case, I believe the C-string here will be null-terminated (when it is written like this). And I think the constructed std::string_view object is just going to have a char* point to the \"code\" or \"static\" section (not sure which).\nAlso in our case, the string_view object itself shouldn\u0027t be long-lived since it is constexpr. (the underlying buffer will be long-lived though).",
