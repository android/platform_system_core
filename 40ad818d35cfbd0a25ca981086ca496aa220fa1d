We need to change adb_lseek interface to allow seeking beyond 2GiB (it\u0027s currently accepting an `int` offset), so that it can fetch the desired block from a package. Note that adb_lseek() is platform dependent, so the call to SetFilePointer() in sysdeps_win32.cpp needs to be updated accordingly.",
