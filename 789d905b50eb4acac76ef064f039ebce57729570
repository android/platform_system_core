But I never liked the original code to fake a /system entry either.  \n\nEspecially now that Fstab is a vector and is easily modifiable, I would rather first stage mount (being the only place where we should worry about adding in this extra /system mount point), always provide either /system or / (if system-as-root) in the fstab that is passed to overlayfs.",
