      "message": "Is all of this fixed if we or in O_NOCTTY to this list of flags?  I\u0027ve been looking this up a bit and it seems that it should fix it too.\n\nFigure that the process doesn\u0027t have any controlling terminal in the case of `adb remount` so if we don\u0027t specify O_NOCTTY, then this terminal becomes the controlling one and we get SIGHUP when we close it().  If we set O_NOCTTY, it shouldn\u0027t become the controlling terminal, so no SIGHUP will be generated.",
