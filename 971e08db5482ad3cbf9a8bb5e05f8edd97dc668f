Are you building with the latest commits from external/conscrypt?\n\nhttp://r.android.com/1112552 accidentally removed the executable but it was reverted in http://r.android.com/1114071 and re-done properly in http://r.android.com/1114072\n\nIf you\u0027ve synced recently enough to have the init.rc changes that you\u0027re trying to comment out then you should have all of the above changes and so the /apex/com.android.conscrypt/bin/boringssl_self_test32 binary should be present and ready.\n\nCan you please clarify:\n 1. Is /apex/com.android.conscrypt/bin/boringssl_self_test32 present on your device? \n 2. Does your device have a 32bit ABI?\n 3. Are you observing the failure consistently or is it flaky?",
