Are you building with the latest commits from external/conscrypt?\n\nhttp://r.android.com/1112552 accidentally removed the executable but it was reverted in http://r.android.com/1114071 and re-done properly in http://r.android.com/1114072\n\nIf you\u0027ve synced recently enough to have the init.rc changes that you\u0027re trying to comment out then you should have all of the above changes and so the /apex/com.android.conscrypt/bin/boringssl_self_test32 binary should be present and ready.\n\nCan you please clarify:\n 1. Is /apex/com.android.conscrypt/bin/boringssl_self_test32 present on your device? \n 2. Does your device have a 32bit ABI?\n 3. Are you observing the failure consistently or is it flaky?",

We\u0027ll need to figure out why that is, it would be interesting to know whether you can reproduce the non-zero exit code when starting the executable after the device has successfully rebooted using your workaround.",
